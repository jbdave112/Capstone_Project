Capstone_Project

This Capstone Project is part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track.

This project is based on the dataset from the City of LAs website and is accessed through API. The dataset reflects incidents of crime dating back from 2010 where each row is a crime incident

The purpose of this project is to hone my data science skills and use python to find trends in the data that can be acted upon to reduce crime

In the end, I was able to identify which areas and times that have statistically significant more crime and what subpopulations are more prone to crime

After testing numerous models using different methods such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting Methods I was able to create a model that predicted the zipcode where a crime will occur in with an accuracy rate of 37.42%

Although I was not able to create a model which reliably predicted where a crime would occur, I believe my overall analysis would be useful to police officers in determining which areas and subpopulations are more prone to crime and policy makers to create legislation that focuses on the more frequent crimes
