"# Capstone_Project" 

This Capstone Project is part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track.

This project is based on the dataset from the City of LAs website and is accessed through API. The dataset reflects incidents of crime dating back from 2010 where each row is a crime incident

The purpose of this project is to hone my data science skills and use python to find trends in the data that can be acted upon to reduce crime
